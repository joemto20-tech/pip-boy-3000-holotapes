### Description

A full media player for the Pip-Boy 3000.

After the intro, RobCo Entertainment Terminal opens a media menu with three
players:

- **MUSIC** - Play WAV playlists. Every folder in the `MUSIC/` folder is a
  "station" (playlist).
- **VIDEOS** - Watch AVI clips from the `VIDEOS/` folder full screen.
- **IMAGES** - View images from the `IMAGES/` folder centered on a black
  background.

### Notice

Try to keep your `.js` and `.json` images less than 30 KB or you will run into
memory issues.

### SD Card Layout

```
MUSIC/
  My Station/
    song-01.wav
    song-02.wav
  Another Station/
    track-01.wav
VIDEOS/
  clip-01.avi
  clip-02.avi
IMAGES/
  picture-01.json
  picture-02.js
  picture-03.img
  fullscreen-01.bin
```

- The `MUSIC/`, `VIDEOS/`, and `IMAGES/` folders are created automatically on
  launch if they do not exist.
- Full file paths must stay under 56 characters. Oversized entries are shown
  dimmed and cannot be opened.

**Music (`MUSIC/`)**

- Only `.wav` files inside station folders are played.
- Files placed directly in `MUSIC/` are ignored.
- Sub-folders inside station folders are ignored (one level only).

**Video (`VIDEOS/`)**

- Only `.avi` files are listed.
- Clips must use the MS RLE codec (8-bit paletted, grayscale) to decode on the
  device. See the holotape development guide for the recommended ffmpeg command.

**Images (`IMAGES/`)**

- `.json` files (1, 2, or 4 bpp) from the Espruino / pip-boy.com image converter
  are parsed and drawn centered on a black background.
- `.js` files are Espruino image strings at **1 or 2 bpp** (the JS string format
  from the converter). They are drawn centered on a black background.
- `.img` files are raw Espruino image strings at **1 or 2 bpp** (the same binary
  data a `.js` image contains, without the code wrapper). They are drawn
  centered on a black background.
- `.bin` files are treated as full-screen (480x320) raw framebuffers and are
  streamed straight to the display.
- Only `.json`, `.js`, `.img`, and `.bin` files are listed; other files are
  ignored.
- Keep image files small (roughly under 30 KB). Very large images can exhaust
  device memory and fail to load.
